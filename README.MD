# Trivial game  
  
This is a simple Trivial-like game where a series of questions with answers are shown to the player and one can answer before time depletes.  
  
#Known bugs
-Actually, the game ends when the last question is shown, instead of when the last question is answered. So there is always one more question than the selected in the setting screen so when it's shown it automatically ends the game
